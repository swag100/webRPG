Create structure for user registration and logging in
This involves letting them sign up and storing their info in the database

Find out how I'd store the user's character information
This includes character appearence, what room they're in, their stats, health, and so on

*Important to focus on serverside BEFORE clientside; 
 The client (including websocket stuff) should come after users can register and 
 their sessions are saved;
 this is so only LOGGED IN USERS can actually be present in the world
