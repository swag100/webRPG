Create structure for user registration and logging in
This involves letting them sign up and storing their info in the database

Find out how I'd store the user's character information
This includes character appearence, what room they're in, their stats, health, and so on

*Important to focus on serverside BEFORE clientside; 
 The client (including websocket stuff) should come after users can register and 
 their sessions are saved;
 this is so only LOGGED IN USERS can actually be present in the world



/* Some Interesting Thoughts To Consider */
/*
Clients send INPUTS to the server, and the server does the logic for every player
Prevents clients from hacking, but seems intense on server

Also, where would a good place be for game server logic?
Like how would i make it ONLY be happening on pages with a canvas?

//useing sessions
//const session = require('express-session');
/*app.use(session({
    secret: process.env.SESS_KEY,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false
}));*/
/*app.post('/get-data', (req, res) => {
    const username = req.session.username;
    const loggedIn = req.session.loggedIn;
    res.send(`Username: ${username}, Logged In: ${loggedIn}`);
});*/
